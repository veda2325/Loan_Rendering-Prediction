# Loan_Rendering-Prediction
The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling on a loan dataset. The dataset includes various features such as credit policy, purpose of the loan, interest rate, installment amount, credit score (FICO), debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and other relevant financial indicators.
